Mysql
mysql -u root -p password


Creating the project from scratch - Assumes that mysql is installed
python3.8 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install django
pip3 install mysqlclient

django-admin startproject appointment_calendar
cd appointment_calendar/

In .gitignore add .env file inside the project folder
IMPORTANT: Since this file is not in source control make sure you do not lose it

This is how to launch the app in prod or dev: sudo docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

Uncomment AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS in the setting.py so Django doesn't allow easy passwords

Dump database:
mysqldump -u root -p appt_calendar > db.dump

Restore database:
mysql -u root -p appt_calendar < db.dump
